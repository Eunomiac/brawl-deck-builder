# Deck & Card Management Strategy Brainstorming

## Class/Component: "Pile"
Represents a *collection of cards*. Anything that can be described as a "collection of cards" will inherit from this class, including:
- the entire cardpool
- players' collections
- commander decks (both user-created and imported)
- lists of cards associated with a commander deck (e.g. "excluded", "maybe cards", "wishlist")
- dynamically-generated sub-sets of larger Piles, generated by analysis features, filters, etc. (e.g. "popular cards you aren't playing" results would be a Pile; and if a player toggles on "creatures only"; the deck Pile should be able to return a Pile instance containing only creatures)
- dynamically-generated search results

### Pile Base Class Features
Any functionality that could be performed on any collection of cards can go into the base Pile class, while more specific requirements can go into subclasses (e.g. "Deck" would inherit from "Pile"). Base functionality would likely include:
- rendering the Pile's contents in various formats
- analysis methods (e.g. "getManaDistribution", "getNewestIncludedSet")
- ability to incorporate and manage "sub-Piles" of cards (e.g. a deck might present its "Lands" as a sub-Pile of `card.type === "land"` cards, allowing them to be manipulated by the user with the same methods as the parent deck)
- logic for adding/removing cards
- validation logic (e.g. "`includesDuplicates`", "`isValidForColorIdentity(colors)`", "`meetsCompanionCriteria(companion)`")
